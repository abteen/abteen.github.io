Hi! I'm a final year PhD student studying Computer Science at the University of Colorado Boulder, advised by Professor Katharina von der Wense. My research is centered around multilingual natural language processing, with a focus on cross-lingual transfer and low-resource languages. At CU, I have been a teaching assistant for graduate and undergraduate NLP, Algorithms, and Data Structures; in Spring 2025 I co-instructed the undergraduate NLP course. 

In addition to my work at CU, I've had the privilege of being a co-organizer of the [AmericasNLP Workshops and Shared Tasks](https://turing.iimas.unam.mx/americasnlp/) since its inception in 2020. In the summer of 2023, I was a junior researcher at JSALT, held in Le Mans, France as a member of the [Better Together](https://jsalt2023.univ-lemans.fr/en/better-together-text-context.html) team. In Spring of 2024, I was lucky to work as a Student Researcher at Google, working on developing novel multicultural and geo-temporal evaluations for Gemini. In 2025, I served as a co-chair for the [NAACL Student Research Workshop](https://naacl2025-srw.github.io/).

Prior to starting my PhD at Boulder, I studied Computer Science and Math at UC Santa Cruz, where I also began conducting research in NLP. I worked with Professor Lyn Walker at the Natural Language and Dialogue Systems Lab, and contributed to projects focused on Dialogue Systems and Natural Language Generation.
